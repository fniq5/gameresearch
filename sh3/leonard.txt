Damage per pellet determined by Leonard animation state

Number of pellets hit is random???

Pellet do 50, 100, or 150 damage

Leonard take 66% damage when standing 

UP+WALK+ACTION always do max damage from standing (396, 4pellet)

Frames 1393~1395 best damage. Exact damage determined by which 
frame each pellet connects.

Shotgun damage occurs across six frames, one for each pellet.
Which is why damage is seemingly more random 
when fire rapidly


HP random from 2350~2650
