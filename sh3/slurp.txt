6 = Quick Attack
7 = Grab Attack (Nibble at feet)
8 = Basic Attack (Lunge)

4FC670 - set_attack_action(slurper);

4F5480 - decide_attack_pattern(slurper);

When sense a vibration, choose an attack pattern:
10% - Charge
45% - Grab
45% - Basic
The current attack pattern is not the same as Slurper's ActionState.
This will trigger each time Heather makes a noise.

Quick turn if Heather is behind Slurper.

Slurpers sense various sounds:
Turn, QuickTurn, Run, Walk, Strafe, Guns

Slurpers will not sense Heather if she is sneaking! (AIM Button)

Vibration/Sound will engage Slurpers within a certain radius:
if(sensed(Slurper, Vibration)) {
  decide_attack(Slurper);
  set_action(Slurper, HUNTING); //3
}

The distance is determined by the type of vibration.
Run and guns are the loudest!
It can hear the knife hit the wall too...


No known difference in behavior between Slurper types (?)
Percentages are not different, atleast.
Perhaps sense ability changes.
